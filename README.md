2016-01-27
----------
- worked on adding test to telemetry side of https://bugzil.la/1232222
  - the way telemetry tests add-ons makes this a little more difficult
    than what we do for add-ons manager, as there's no simple way to
    restart the AddonManager and the system add-on must be present in
    the features dir when the add-ons manager starts up

2016-01-26

    - "thin shim over Chromium's Content module"
    - https://github.com/atom/brightray
  - not if it has process separation, or at least chrome/content distinction
    - looks like the chromium content module embedding supports sandboxing
      - http://www.chromium.org/developers/content-module
