Currently working on
=====================
- experiments architecture engineering plan for 2019 H1
- triaging shield-utils / pioneer utils
- talk to folks about experiments case study for next year
- move shield utils to tree (probably under Normandy component)

Daily(ish) log
==============
2019-02-25
----------
- figured out a path forward for exposing debugging UI for experiments extensions to devs/QA
  - https://github.com/biancadanforth/webextensions-examples/pull/2#issuecomment-467189806
- doing some self-triage on open bugs
  - ask chutten if he is planning to use `libprio` directly in a few bugs so I could potentially just close out a few `PrioEncoder`-specific bugs
  - managed to close out this old "off-train updates should get perf/correctness testing" bug \o/
    - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1427858#c5
  - (finally) followed up on old bug about improving feedback mechanisms for experiments
    - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1454425
  - untangled some build issues with `libprio` and `msgpack` so we can stop exporting `msgpack` in `xul.dll`
    - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1523312
  - unassigned a bunch of old non-critical Add-ons Manager related bugs and set myself as mentor
- spent some time watching a talk from All Hands about upcoming Fission changes and how they impact working on frontend Firefox

2019-02-22
----------
- followed up on omni jar/xpi corruption bug
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1515173#c21
- commented in bdanforth's proposal to use options page and browser storage instead of prefs
  - https://github.com/biancadanforth/webextensions-examples/pull/2
  - lgtm overall, have a few questions/suggestions to see if we can not have to bundle anything with extension

2019-02-19
----------
- planning upcoming work landing shield utils in-tree
  - https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-utils/issues/278

2019-02-14
----------
- opened PR for libprio security fix
  - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/pull/65
  - had to fix a bug causing travis failures
    - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/pull/66
    - need to make this more robust, although it's just an occasional annoyance so not the biggest deal. tl;dr is that libprio needs a newer NSS than Travis-CI's ubuntu distro (trusty) provides, so the latest packages are downloaded and installed, and these URLs can change over time.

2019-02-11
----------
- client impl guidelines for experiments PR up for review
  - https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-data-docs/pull/248
  - this includes bdanforth's work on using Mozilla CI to test extensions, mentioned previously in this status doc
- testing optimizations for tryserver+extension tests
  - minimal set of perf tests
  - leak tests
  - use artifact builds for above if all possible ^
- commented on Prio+Telemetry implementation
  - chatted w/ chutten a bit, leaving ultimate decisions up to him and Telemetry client folks, but I am available to chat whenever they need. Discussed some C++ vs. JS implementation details
    - libprio is flexible enough to accomodate both, probably this will be behind the nsITelemetry (C++) and Prio will then be behind Telemetry, Prio probably does not need to be exposed to any other components.
- reached out to folks implementing upcoming experiments, making them aware of above and also answering questions and concerns from folks running it.

2018-10-16
----------
- meetings, 1:1
- first draft at experiments engineering plan
  - responded to comments
- figured out problem w/ privileged code in shield study
  - only when in XPI form, the panel in the content loads slower from XPI than from file apparently, so need to listen for `DOMContentLoaded` or so
- followup to pref off Prio telemetry tests if `prio.enabled` is false, so it doesn't bust beta
  - prio is on by default for Nightly, off everywhere else.

- re-visited issue about having so many different client- and
  server-side update mechanisms
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1323547
- looked into providing telemetry http fallback (after discussion in slack)
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1494571
  - considered providing a generic mechanism for this in ServerRequest.jsm,
    but it's probably too special-purpose to worry too much about it.
- chatted w/ motin re: openwpm experiment
  - sent some examples, will put together something more illustrative
- Prio-related
  - looked into automated Windows tests
    - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/issues/42

    - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/pull/39
  - filed bug about moving libprio init out of static method, to make cleanup simpler
    - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1493584
  - worked w/ Telemetry server folks on documentation

2018-09-19 -> 2018-09-21
------------------------
- followed up on active projects
  - NSS bug blocking Prio on Windows fixed \o/
    - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1489691
    - will be vendored into m-c soon
- fielded questions internally on Telemetry Coverage projet
  - https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2018/08/20/effectively-measuring-search-in-firefox/
  - responded to folks on HN, reddit forums seem largely OK
  - looking at how we can communicate more effectively in future.

2018-09-18
----------
- shipped Telemetry Coverage \o/
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487578
  - going to do a post-mortem on where we can invest and move faster / estimate better next time
- more advice for JAWS-ESR project
  - since ESR is about to do a point-release, going to just land in-tree so advised on that.
  - also reviewed https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D6191

2018-09-17
----------
- Telemetry Coverage extension passed QA, all ready to ship:
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487578
- rewriting PrioEncoder standalone manually-run browser-test as unit test
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1485620
  - turned out to be quite easy to do as a googletest
    - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1485620#c5
    - waiting for review
    - having Travis-CI
- helped with JAWS-ESR SAO update
- reviewed planned back-out of Fennec GWS/FB UA spoofing SAO
  - https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D6065
- looked at why Fedora builds are failing w/ libprio enabled
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1491289
  - just include header path shenanigans... would be nice to re-vendor libprio anyway
- met w/ bdanforth re: experiment perf testing in the field
  - we could probably do an experiment just around this and help Firefox out as a whole
- let mobile folks know about libprio and size impact
- attached patch to fix PrioEncoder crash on bad public keys in prefs
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1491737
  - these are in prefs so we can set remotely, PrioEncoder is supposed to be able to
  handle it but the problem is that it is a singleton and it fails correctly the first time, but it instantiates the singleton too soon. added a test as well not that we have a basic gtest for it.
- chatted w/ ted re: replacing msgpack dependency on libprio
  - libprio only uses it internally for serializing binary data, not used on the wire
  - msgpack doesn't support aarch64 at least, probably other bugs / missing things we'll need to fix if we stick with it
    - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1486478
  - using Rust + Serde from C is an option! We might even be able to move libprio's build system over to Cargo and away from SCons which'd be super cool

2018-09-10
----------
- responded to reviewer comments for telemetry coverage extension
  - https://github.com/mozilla/one-off-system-add-ons/pull/123
  - confirmed that we don't need to send a special UUID or anything, might do this later if we add retry ability
    - rewriting this to work on 64+ (webextension-only) and also for old releases will be tricky... maybe factor out the common stuff into scripts that can be run with content privileges. Really only things that need to be privileged are:
      1. the pref read to see if Telemetry is enabled and
      2. to grab the update channel and
      3. the Telemetry UUID (to pass to the sampling function
      The actual sampling function and the connection to mozilla servers could all be done from content and script could be shared across legacy/webextension+experiments
- landed PrioEncoder + Telemetry client patch \o/
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1465251
  - jumped the gun a little on Telemetry review; talked w/ reviewer and worked it out, Telemetry folks want more formal review process for their module which is totally reasonable, will wait for explicit r+ next time (I had addressed the comments and then landed with a secondary reviewer's r+)
  - only macOS and Linux for now, will start sending data as soon as Nightly goes out around 10 PM Pacific
    - windows blocked on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1489691
      - I am helping out with this, getting everything going on Windows to test has been a bear..
        - instructions are very outdated: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Building
        - readme is a little more modern but build.sh requires a lot of variables to be set up which is really obnoxious
          - turns out https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1434943 has a nice patch for Windows + MSVC!
          - libprio requires clang though, MSVC C compiler is too old (C90 vs. C99 standard)
          - might have to figure out how to get standalone nss+nspr building w/ clang-cl on Windows. This is how the mozilla-central build system does it though so must be doable :)
  - server work happening in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1465252
    - chatted w/ server folk to make sure they know it will be coming in
- looked into snag for open-wpm
  - https://github.com/devtools-html/har-export-trigger/issues/13#issuecomment-418694386
  - this is... pretty involved. I think we'll probably need to lean on devtools and addons folks for help here.

2018-09-03
----------
- Holiday (Labor day)

2018-08-31
----------
- PTO

2018-08-30
----------
- created public bug for Telemetry Coverage project
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487578
  - we now have a way for users to opt-out, and sent instructions to QA with this info.
- Finished up some little PRs to move standalone libprio to Clang (turned out to be a lot of work because Travis uses Ubuntu Trust which is super old! I ended up setting up a local Travis docker install which was worth it), fix opt/debug build config in SCons, and to clean up some undefined behavior in an ASCII version of a stdlib function I added.
  - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed
- that dang MSVC PrioEncoder patch caused prio to not be built on *all* platforms, because apparently I forgot how to python
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1485946
  - easy fix, just embarassing
- PTO rest of the day

2018-08-09 -> 2018-08-29
------------------------
- super busy the last few weeks, catching up:
  - landed libprio + PrioEncoder, shipped in Nightly \o/
    - some followup work
      - provided easy way to disable building libprio + PrioEncoder, via MOZ_LIBPRIO flag
        - hit this issue with MSVC which is tier-2 and which we will almost certainly never ship again,has an ancient C compiler (C90). Encouraging upstream to make Clang the first-class compiler, since folks like Firefox and Chromium are moving that way anyway.
          - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1485946
        - set up travis-ci for upstream libprio, so we don't have to wait until we re-vendor the thing into Firefox to find problems.
          - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/pull/22
      - re-implemented some ASCII-only versions of std functions like toupper/isxdigit, due to these being locale-dependent
        - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/pull/24
      - started looking at moving the libprio (manually run) browser-test over to a proper Firefox unit test
        - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1485620
        - asking for advice from DOM folks, thinking that we'll probably want to expose this to JS (for the xpcshell unit test runner) via some new DOM functions which are behind a test-only pref.
          - browser-test is C code that invokes xpcshell, but for Firefox what we need is for xpcshell to be able to invoke the native code.
    - passed the ball over to Telemetry folks
      - client integration should be simple, provided sample code
        - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1465251
      - server integration + analysis probably a bit more involved, pointed to some example code there as well but likely we'll want to build some standalone tools using libprio. I don't think this should be a blocker on getting the client code shipped and starting to collect the data.
        - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1465252
  - working on Telemetry Coverage
    - https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2018/08/20/effectively-measuring-search-in-firefox/
    - taking a bit more time than expected but trying to do it right
  - investigated problems with OpenWPM study
    - https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM-WebExtension-Experiment/pull/4
    - reached out to rpl and devtools folks, they just missed their GH mentions, on the case now

2018-08-09
----------
- reviewed WebCompat GoFaster extension to Fennec
  - https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D3012
- I *think* I've ironed out the last of the blockers for the Prio prototype landing in Firefox
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421501
  - have a good cross-platform try run now
- put up example usage of Prio for client
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1465251#c7
- starting rewriting prio integration test for latest API
  - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/issues/7
  - got some nice modern JS digs in too

2018-08-08
----------
- focused on libprio+firefox cross-platform build issues w/ help from Henry and Franziskus
- reviewed OpenWPM-WebExtension-Experiment
  - https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM-WebExtension-Experiment/pull/4/files
  - don't see anything concerning, will take another look tomorrow

2018-08-07
----------
- pushed new patch, few questions for DOM reviewer but feeling close now
- started working on linux/windows build problems for libprio
  - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/issues/4
  - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/issues/3

2018-08-06
----------
- worked through build integration problems from last friday:
  - vendored msgpack + integrated
  - used in-tree NSS mpi lib
  - need to do a few supporting changes in libprio but nothing major
  - getting further on tryserver, hitting some cross-platform issues like:
    - linux is unhappy with multiple main functions, this is because we're building an NSS mpi file that we just don't need, this can be fixed in the libprio moz.build integration in my patch
    - windows doesn't provide `<strings.h>` but does provide `<string.h>`, if that's not enough for libprio then I'll need to make some further changes but initial results on macOS (which is my primary dev environment) look good

2018-08-03
----------
- got back prio review responses
  - little more work to do on the DOM bit
  - turned up some build system integration problems (one turned up by tryserver and one found by NSS reviewer):
    - need to vendor msgpack
    - need to use in-tree private NSS mpi lib not the copy in libprio

2018-08-02
----------
- got buy-in on prio plan mentioned yesterday
  - pushed latest patches for review
    - I wasn't able to resolve some of the DOM concerns (was crashing trying to use suggested Mozilla string libraries when passing to C etc) so asked for help on those

2018-08-01
----------
- started working through Prio DOM review
  - going to try to land current approach and then follow-up with new requirements from the meeting a few weeks ago
- followed up on github mentions
  - https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-utils/issues/254#issuecomment-408998204

2018-07-23
----------
- worked on adding ArrayBuffer support for PrioEncoder
  - this is more important now, since we're talking about sending
  way more Telemetry through.
  - getting hung up on silly issue with `nsCOMPtr<nsIGlobalObject>`
  being easily available but not the `JSContext` (which would be accessible from the global passed to the constructor via `aGlobal.Context()`).
    - this is one of those issues where it's easy to fix (keep a reference to the JS context around) but more about trying to figure out how the existing code does it so it's more likely to pass review
- responded to bug about making Normandy use ServiceRequest vs
raw fetch
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1471946#c19
  - I filed this because I noticed Normandy wasn't doing NSS beConservative, since we're using it for hotfixes and we only serve signed content
  - I wrote up a patch to wrap XHR (which is what ServiceRequest is
  built on top of) but expose it with a fetch-like API, however per comment above I think we should just go a few levels deeper and
  1. expose underlying network channel from fetch to system JS
  2. expose simple fetch wrapper from `ServiceRequest.jsm` that sets all the right network channels
  3. get sec review on this

2018-07-17
----------
- back after being out w/ flu for a week
- reviewed+merged outstanding libprio PRs
  - https://github.com/rhelmer/gecko-dev/pull/2
  - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/pull/1
- https://github.com/mozilla/libprio/ is now the official upstream \o/
- followed up on TLS 1.3 fallback-limit roll-out
  - there's a hotfix we might want to block on to make the analysis cleaner, unsure.
- emailed nika about prio review
- sought out engineering design/architecture advice

2018-07-12
----------
- responded to henry's email re: recent prio PR
- reviewed idle callback patch for nsUpateTimerManager
  - waaay simpler than I thought it was going to be
  - https://bugzil.la/1373408

2018-07-11
----------
- shipped TLS fallback limit to 25%
  - did a little telemetry notebook debugging first
- got back to henry re: hex-to-bin library
  - had looked into it last (holiday) week but not followed up yet
  - tl;dr nothing easily reusable, just utility functions in skia / nss
  - henry is going to do it in prio and expose function to import hex-encoded keys
- rebased prio client against latest m-c

2018-07-10
----------
- PTO (still out sick)

2018-07-09
----------
- pushed TLS fallback limit to release 61 at 10%
- didn't get as much done as I'd like, starting feeling sick

----------
- worked on prio client

2018-07-04
----------
- US holiday

2018-07-03
----------
- went to MV for meetings
- figured out plan for landing prio client

2018-06-28
----------
- prio sec review (client-side)
  - https://bugzil.la/1421501#c17
- filed bug + submitted patch for normandy to use ServiceRequest instead of raw fetch()
  - https://bugzil.la/1471946

2018-06-27
----------
- so many meetings
  - prio RRA (server side stuff mostly, little early for it)
  - telemetry for normandy pref-flip roll-outs
  - other follow up from yesterday
- kept working through review feedback for prio impl

2018-06-26
----------
- worked on review feedback for prio impl
- more meetings than usual
- investigated update history

2018-06-25
----------
- helped w/ florian's study

2018-06-22
----------
- finished reviewing new TAAR study
  - https://bugzil.la/1469546
- set up mozilla repo for libprio, so henrycg can do a PR and get NSS peer to look at it that way
  - some confusion in the bug because upstream lib has both client and server parts, would be better
  to resolve all of this in the repo, and have a mozilla-controlled upstream repo anyway
  - https://github.com/mozilla/libprio

2018-06-21
----------
- fwd'd review for libprio-specific bits to henrycg
- helped out w/ intern shield study
- reviewed shield pref flip study patch
  - https://bugzil.la/1465195
  - nothing really for me to do here
- reviewed new TAAR study
  - https://bugzil.la/1469546
- took a look w/ chutten at TLS 1.3 telemetry notebooks
- chatted w/ bdanforth about testing strategy for study extensions, ahead of test infra meeting
- met w/ intern working on prio

2018-06-20
----------
- started exploring on better experiments + firefox integration for shield study needs
- chatted w/ relman re: tls roll-out plans for next few releases
  - need to send intent-to-ship emails for next round soon
- put prio prototype patches up for review \o/
  - https://bugzil.la/1421501

2018-06-19
----------
- PTO in morning
- working on generating test private/public keypairs for this prio code so I can get it up for review
  - found it easiest to just make a little python script use libsodium for generating CURVE25519 keypairs
    - https://gist.github.com/rhelmer/3331ca166bcc9ee05c21a1834fa58cea
  - this is fine for testing purposes but will make sure the sec folks generate and handle this key as
  part of review for the version we actually ship.. can put the public key in a pref
- still working on that python telemetry notebook too
  - mythmon helped with this so now have the basic query working at least
- chatted w/ add-ons and experiments folks about upcoming shield study
  - tl;dr is that it's been prototyped as a legacy extension, I actually already chatted in person w/ folks
  last week about converting this over to bundled webext experiment, should be nbd
  - sent some docs and examples to interested folks
- reviewed patch to re-enable temporary extension unit tests on windows followin race condition fix
  - https://bugzil.la/1469686

2018-06-18
----------
- worked on python telemetry notebook for tracking TLS fallback-limit via normandy on beta
  - https://dbc-caf9527b-e073.cloud.databricks.com/#notebook/16917/command/16952
- talked w/ henry @ stanford re: prio next steps
  - henry suggested putting public key somewhere we can easily change; using a pref or passing
  to the C++ constructor would work
  - henry is working on command-line encrypt/decrypt tools for Telemetry server's use
- sent prio status to ekr's intern
  - meeting set up later in the week

2018-06-11 -> 2018-06-15
------------------------
- mozilla all-hands

2018-06-07
----------
- debugged why my local build is broken
  - some XPI generation issue, both artifact and full builds
- landed savant bug for bdanforth
  - autoland kicked back due to merge issue
  - she looked into and was an issue where hg bookmark needed to be updated
- moved my prio work from git over to hg
  - old moz-git-tools repo has a handy tool for taking a git format-patch
  output to something hg import can handle
    - https://github.com/mozilla/moz-git-tools/blob/master/git-patch-to-hg-patch

2018-06-06
----------
- talked to ursula re: split up work for prio
  - suggested reviewer for my part, contacted and lined that up
- pushed new version of TLS 1.3 roll-out to bug (for release)

2018-06-05
----------
- met about new shield utils webext experiments review
  - glind already split out commits for me, should be done reviewing today
  - meeting next week to talk about engineering, not going to sweat
  the details or block them shipping right now

2018-06-01
----------
- looked at results of beta fallback-limit push, so far so good

2018-05-30
----------
- kicked off perf+correctness testing for new shield study utils, as
  part of reviewing
  - https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=f3d72bddf60c5ae496ed186a139644ac7cd60150
- pushed TLS 1.3 fallback-limit on release (SAO) and beta (normandy)

2018-05-29
----------
- 1:1
- filed bugs splitting up prio work, so I can land the DOM bit sooner
- helped out bdanforth w/ savant study-related questions

2018-05-28
----------
- PTO (US Holiday)

2018-05-24
----------
- reviewed bug for bdanforth's Savant shield study
  - needs to ship w/ Firefox behind a pref
- started working on testing for Fennec system add-on update bug
  - https://bugzil.la/1260213

2018-05-15
----------
- reviewed bug about divorcing SAO update from app.update.enabled pref
  - https://bugzil.la/1428459
  - second round, r+
- responded to needinfo about signing built-in extensions
- corresponding w/ henrycg about using the prio API correctly
  - I wasn't collecting all of the output from `PrioClient_encode`, getting closer
    to the expected result except the number of elements in the "forServerA" array
    is larger than "forServerB"... clarifying whether this is expected or a sign I
    am doing something wrong
- merged AES removal from libprio vendoring
  - https://github.com/rhelmer/gecko-dev/pull/1
  - fixed some merge conflicts
  - made sure that henry landed the same change in the upstream libprio github repo,
    as we're probably going to automate vendoring and checking for updates etc. in Firefox
    eventually.

2018-05-14
----------
- sent some questions from prelim review to henrycg
  - pointer ownership and cleanup questions
  - quick question about simplifying the JS API
- helped bdanforth test the easier XPI loading integration for mochitest
  - seems to work

2018-05-07
----------
- needinfo'd folks on bug about whether SAO updates should be active in safe-mode
  - https://bugzil.la/1459186
  - built-ins are not deactivated, and updates are. this was done on purpose, but
    worth reconsidering.
    - ended up wontfix'ing, not worth changing as it matches current user expectation

2018-05-04
----------
- reviewed SAO for UA override on Fennec
  - https://bugzil.la/1453691
  - patch lgtm; made some suggestions for bullet-proofing it more, like the ability
    to sync data and not require a code update just to add/remove domains/UA strings
  - needinfo'd kmag because I know he's working on some build system cleanup which
    should be reused by this, so they will either wait for him to land or take that
    part of his patch now.

2018-05-03
----------
- decided to just return array-of-arrays from `PrioEncoder.encode()` for now, since
  we're only encoding two 8-bit bytes right now. Will bring this up in code review,
  but don't think it should block testing.
- clarified the use of the release-sysaddon test channel for QA
  - https://bugzil.la/1458579
- looked into push of Google search fix SAO update, working overall but not seeing
  it in super old versions like Firefox 43
  - https://bugzil.la/1454443
  - looking into the history of system add-on feature, looks like we have built-in
    extensions working in this timeframe but not updates, so won't work for this
    version
  - pushing a classic Hotfix add-on would work if this is important enough to bother

2018-05-02
----------
- looked into why espr study isn't seeing as many pings as expected
  - wondering if it's due to a missing `await` on an `async` function that gets
    called during early return of `startup()`...
  - https://github.com/motin/esper-pioneer-shield-study/issues/26#issuecomment-386145068
- looked into sentry exception coming from activity stream
  - https://bugzil.la/1458621
- reviewed bug about moving dictionaries into the omni jar
  - https://bugzil.la/1457321
  - r+'d with a question about why this even needs to use the terrible build system
    hack I put in for system add-ons in 57 to generate a list of acceptable add-on IDs,
    versus just using the index of the JAR...

2018-04-27
----------
- hooked up error checking for PrioEncoder and pushed to github
  - promise rejects now if there's any error in underlying libprio calls
- spent the rest of the day on wrapping libprio's output in an Array of
  ArrayBuffers. Having unexpected problems with the ToJSValue() template
  

2018-04-26
----------
- figured out my libprio string problem, batchID is passed to libprio correctly now \o/
- helped bdanforth figure out where to start up their code
  - https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/nsBrowserGlue.js is probably the best place - this is per-session rather than per-window, like browser.js
  - the trick is to init after the observer notification you want is observed, ideally as late in browser startup as possible: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Observer_Notifications
    - by-the-by, that page would probably be a good candidate to move to https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/ and use autodoc to generate

2018-04-25
----------
- attended Normandy brain-dump meeting, took notes
- put together beginning of architecture doc based on normandy notes
- chatted w/ bdanforth re: integration of the savant study
  - going to land it in-tree vs. using an extension

2018-04-24
----------
- spent most of the day trying to figure out how strings work in mozilla C++ code
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Guide/Internal_strings
  - context is needing to convert an `nsString` to `const unsigned char*` to use w/ libprio
    C code

2018-04-19
----------
- spent the morning dealing with aftermath of MBP upgrade
  - got my apple ID working and downloading xcode so I could actually build firefox locally again
- hacked on prio and reported status to group
  - imported latest prio and start working with the newest API
  - todo:
    - hooking up the right public keys
    - adding some error checking that's compatible with the way our C++/JS bindings work
    - some simple tests to make sure the integration is working
    - actually return `ArrayBuffers` in the `Promise` that `encode()` returns
      - right now it is just a pair of strings

2018-04-18
----------
- hacked on prio integration
  - henrycg pushed new version w/ some API changes that needed to be imported
  - pretty close to feature complete!
- prepared TLS 1.3 system add-on updates
  - https://bugzil.la/1448176
  - https://bugzil.la/1448176


2018-04-17
----------
- met re: updates
- attended github integration meeting
  - other than vendoring from upstream projects, mostly interested in how test integration should
    work for things like studies and system add-ons that never land in m-c but nevertheless get shipped
    to some subset of users
- reviewed re-launch of ESPR study
  - https://bugzil.la/1450951

2018-04-16
----------
- made plans re: Normandy arch docs
  - firefox-source-docs.m.o (built from m-c source) is probably the most discoverable right now
  - GH pages or google docs also an option, maybe linked from above
  - good support for diagrams (ideally something like graphviz) might make the choice for us
  - regardless of actual hosting would be ideal to have an authoritation mozilla.org URL or at least link to it from one

2018-04-11
----------
- reviewed bug cleaning up Cert.jsm exports
  - https://bugzil.la/1453123

2018-04-09
----------
- hacked on prio dom integration
  - made closer to mozilla c++ style guide
  - starting working on testing
    - adding a JS test for the `PrioEncoder` DOM method should be easy, but actually testing
      that prio is returning the right result is trickier... might just do that bit in C++
      so I can use the verification code that's already in libprio
  - upgraded MBP to high sierra, had to re-install a bunch of build tools (xcode, rust, etc)
- out most of afternoon getting iphone repaired and new cord for MBP

2018-04-05
----------
- review normandy client related bug
  - https://bugzil.la/1451911
- chatted w/ henrycg re: prio
  - libprio should do its own (de)serialization in C, so callers don't have to deal with it
    - henry suggested a few third-party libs like msgpack and flatbuffers, I think the licenses are probably OK
      - henry decided on msgpack
  - also asked henry if it's easy enough to relicense libprio as MPL 2.0 to make our legal review smoother
    - he will do so!

2018-04-03
----------
- so many meetings

2018-04-01
----------
- read PHD docs for upcoming study
- updated gradual TLS 1.3 release channel roll-out for 50%
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042

  - https://bugzil.la/1442042

2018-03-29
----------
- finished review on pioneer news study 2
  - followed up on GH issue re: browser console warnings when installing extension
    - https://github.com/mozilla/pioneer-study-online-news-2/issues/25
- needinfo'd relman on TLS 1.3 for beta
  - https://bugzil.la/1448176
- followed up w/ activitystream folks on availability of API for messaging in newtab
- worked more on prio prototype
    - turns out there's a location in-tree for chrome-only
      webidl, allows for slightly nicer webidl
    - opened a PR to wrap `extern C {}` around prio's header file, so I can get it out
      of moz code (already put this in the vendored version too)
        - https://github.com/henrycg/libprio/pull/2
    - https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/compare/master...rhelmer:bug1421501-prio-prototype


2018-03-28
----------
- TLS 1.3 release channel roll-out shipped at 20%
- pretty close to an actual working prio impl now! most of the right types are wired up now,
  and the prio code actually runs when you call `.encode()`
    - https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/compare/master...rhelmer:bug1421501-prio-prototype

2018-03-27
----------
- reviewed pioneer news study 2
- sent (late) intent-to-ship emails for TLS roll-outs
- asked for TLS 1.3 release roll-out to ship
- emailed about prio
  - have the actual prio code running inside the PrioEncoder DOM method now
  - https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/compare/master...rhelmer:bug1421501-prio-prototype

2018-03-26
----------
- got basic Prio example working \o/
  - https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/compare/master...rhelmer:bug1421501-prio-prototype
  - vendoring and linking libprio, using it from webidl impl code
  - emailed folks
- chatted w/ rdalal re: pioneer
  - chrome manifest resource:// registration removed on nightly
    - use current approach + test on unbranded builds for 59+60
    - work on webextension approach for 61
- chatted w/ rstrong re: pref flip on older Fx
  - sysaddon support first landed in 43 so might be enough, need to test
  - rstrong to file bug

2018-03-22
----------
- reviewed testing strategy for shield studies w/ bdanforth
  - we both took copious notes
    - tl;dr - we want to make dev workflow the basic github workflow -
      add-ons are developed using normal add-on tools, and the mozilla
      TaskCluster CI bits are integrated via GH webhooks etc.
      as in CircleCI/Travis
  - followup action items
    - bdanforth to set up meeting w/ jmaher and myself
      also, invite me to shield dev workflow meeting next week
    - I will contact myk melez re: github working group
      - done, will catch up on their progress and attend
- Updated TLS 1.3 release channel roll-out add-on to 10%
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
- Created new bug to roll out TLS 1.3 fallback-limit to Beta
  - https://bugzil.la/1448176
  - this is basically the same as above, but different pref and
    targeted at Beta only. Beta already has TLS 1.3 enabled, this
    stops fallback.
- Worked a bit on Prio webidl

2018-03-21
----------
- looked into issue w/ TP study not working on restart
  - bug in Firefox (RecentWindow.jsm), appears to be fixed in 60+
    - study is running on 59
  - bdanforth changed add-on to use RecentWindow.jsm consistently
    which works around it
  - study paused while we looked at it and will be relaunched shortly

2018-03-20
----------
- followed up w/ QA re: TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - put together telemetry query to track
    - https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/52077
  - attached v5 for signing, which bumps from 1% to 5% per ekr
    - also tested, hosted and needinfo'd relman
- 1:1
  - discussed topics from TODO.md

2018-03-19
----------
- followed up w/ QA re: TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
  - shipped to release \o/
  - putting together telemetry report, both to check uptake of add-om
    and also to measure effect more directly
    - ekr has an ipython notebook from previous experiments that can be
      adapted for this purpose
      - forked https://github.com/rhelmer/telemetry_utils
- reviewed bug re: directory service overrides for add-ons manager tests
  - https://bugzil.la/1446833

2018-03-16
----------
- followed up w/ QA re: TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
  - tried shipping but no relman support available
    - also QA 
    - updated ekr on status, ETA for shipping monday
- made decision on Prio prototype
  - taking the original course - webidl

2018-03-15
----------
- followed up w/ QA re: TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
  - working correctly now
  - ekr asked if we can use 1% instead of 10% for initial roll-out,
    should be fine but will require the add-on to be modified and re-signed
  - attached new XPI to bug for testing and ping'd QA

2018-03-14
----------
- followed up w/ QA re: TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
  - full test instructions used this time
  - add-on itself works, but logic that chooses 10% of profiles
    does not seem to be working for QA when creating new profiles.
    I'll try it again myself today
- met w/ bdanforth re: final tryserver result review for TP study
  - https://github.com/biancadanforth/tracking-protection-shield-study/issues/26#issuecomment-372816318

2018-03-13
----------
- followed up w/ QA re: TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
- looked into build problems w/ bdanforth on TP study

2018-03-12
----------
- followed up w/ QA re: TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
  - need to make instructions more explicit.. maybe host on balrog test channel
- worked a bit on getting built-in add-ons into the omni jar
  - https://bugzil.la/1357205
- emailed followup re: system add-on compat to dev-firefox/platform
  - https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/firefox-dev/2018-March/006186.html

2018-03-09
----------
- PTO

2018-03-07
----------
- added steps for QA for TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
  - looks like we're still waiting on the pref to be rolled back on beta...
- did some testing for ulfr
- tested standalone prio
  - got building on macOS and sent PR etc.

2018-03-06
----------
- chatted w/ QA re: TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
- took a look at latest prio work

2018-03-05
----------
- packaged up XPI and put in PI request for TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
- last-minute TAAR help + review
  - went over options to exclude private browsing windows
    - specifically, *any* open browser windows, not just the most
      recently active
  - https://github.com/motin/taar-experiment-v2-shield-study/pull/18
  - https://bugzil.la/1428308
- attended TP study review meeting / demo

2018-03-02
----------
- addressed review comments on add-on for TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
  - https://github.com/mozilla/one-off-system-add-ons/pull/96
- figured out plan w/ add-on folks for moving built-in add-ons to omni jar
  - https://bugzil.la/1357205
  - going to start moving away from "system add-on" naming
    - something like "built-in"
    - updates in the future will come as normandy-installed hidden add-ons,
      again moving away from "system add-on" nomenclature
- met w/ benson
- finished up review changes on add-on for TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
  - https://github.com/mozilla/one-off-system-add-ons/pull/96

2018-03-01
----------
- worked on add-on for TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
  - https://github.com/mozilla/one-off-system-add-ons/pull/96
- attended update meeting
  - caught people up on system add-on, gmp, normandy, etc. plans
  - also mentioned ServiceRequest so folks know it exists

2018-02-28
----------
- advised prio folks on technical issues integrating w/ Firefox
  - C vs. C++, memory allocation, etc.
- filed bug for TLS 1.3 gradual roll-out
  - https://bugzil.la/1442042
- worked on exposing `fetch` interface from ServiceRequest.jsm
  - first attempt was to polyfill w/ already-subclassed XHR
    - original bug just subclasses XHR
      - https://bugzil.la/1325501
    - however, `fetch` cannot be subclassed, as it is just a function
      and not a class such as XMLHttpRequest. providing a proxy
      function which calls it is probably the way to go.

      The only problem with this is that built-in `fetch` does not
      expose the underlying network channel (for settings things such
      as conservative TLS settings), so Fetch.webidl would need to be
      modified to do so (XHR has a chrome-only mechanism for doing this)
- looked at panel issue with TP study, where it is staying open due to
  the `blur` event acting on panels as well as regular windows (panels
  are a type of `ChromeWindow`) - bdanforth is looking at how to detect
  these, so the intro panel gets closed only if users either accept
  or explicitly switch windows
  - https://github.com/biancadanforth/tracking-protection-shield-study/issues/111
  - regressed by https://github.com/biancadanforth/tracking-protection-shield-study/pull/109/files

2018-02-27
----------
- looked at window-closing panel issue on TP study
  - https://github.com/biancadanforth/tracking-protection-shield-study/issues/103
- re-investigated and commented on bug about moving built-in add-ons to omni jar
  - https://bugzil.la/1357205
- worked on wrapping fetch for ServiceRequest.jsm
  - this is so we use consistent settings for requests coming from Firefox
  - original bug just subclasses XHR
    - https://bugzil.la/1325501

2018-02-26
----------
- discussed slow roll-out for a few features w/ folks
  - normandy not ready til ~61
    - https://github.com/mozilla/normandy/projects/23
  - system add-on probably the way to go in the meantime

2018-02-23
----------
- finished review for system add-on enterprise policy
  - https://bugzil.la/1436851
- out for part of day with vet emergency
- chatted w/ tor folk re: system add-ons on fennec
  - https://bugzil.la/1440789
  - tl;dr - moz build folks would prefer a better packaging mechanism
    such as https://bugzil.la/988938
- responded to willkg question regarding hive ADI socorro fetcher
  - https://bugzil.la/1440745

2018-02-21
----------
- looked at quirk of lazy-loading in TP shield study
- reviewed one of the patches on bug about controlling system add-ons with
  enterprise policies
    - https://bugzil.la/1436851
- chatted w/ tor folks about porting legacy add-on to mobile
    - tl;dr - might be OK in the short-term, not really the right thing
      long-term. maybe either make native messaging work on mobile, or
      switch to something android-specific

2018-02-20
----------
- chatted w/ bdanforth re: final unit test failure for TP study
    - doesn't happen during manual testing
    - test only happens when WebRequest is being used
    - tl;dr - shouldn't block, but worth investigating (would be
      interesting to see if webextension using `browser.webRequest` triggers it as well)
- chatted w/ prio folks re: firefox integration
    - going to do it as a standalone library and server/client examples
    - we can either ship this inside Firefox or possibly as an add-on via shield
        - could either js-ctypes or (maybe safer) just call the standalone
        client executable

2018-02-09

    - TP study randomly picks control or treatment branches
    - bdanforth will land workarounds in hg.m.o/try for both
- prio progress
  - enough C++ implemented to compile + show up in Browser Console
    - https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/compare/master...rhelmer:bug1421501-prio-prototype?expand=1

    - https://bugzil.la/1427471
    - r+'d after a few questions to make sure we wouldn't bust blocklist or SAO updates for desktop or fennec (distro builds do their own thing but I think we'll be OK in this case too)

- started working on prototype
- pushed old bug w/ cleanup of issues found in AddonsManager found
  with Flow over the finish line
  - https://bugzil.la/1395425

2017-11-21
----------
- wrote firefox-dev post about jsdoc+sphinx integration
  - https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/firefox-dev/2017-November/005955.html
- review for high-priority telemetry/addons manager crash
  - aswan is out and kmag is busy
  - https://bugzil.la/1381633
- learned a bit more about constructing proofs using arithmetic circuits
  and multi-party computation, for a prototype
- reviewed one-off experiment
- looked into how to enable legacy add-ons in local beta build
  - `ac_add_options "MOZ_ALLOW_LEGACY_EXTENSIONS=1"`
  - waiting for unbranded builds to be fixed
    - https://bugzil.la/1414450
- coordinated w/ relman about shipping hotfix color distortion in video on AMD
  - https://bugzil.la/1418556

2017-11-20
----------
- landed jsdoc+sphinx+firefox integration \o/
  - https://bugzil.la/1389341
- investigated options for calling standalone rust code
  - Firefox subprocess module can call standalone binaries
    - https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/modules/subprocess/toolkit\_modules/subprocess/index.html
  - jsctypes can load a library into an existing process
    - can introduce stability problems and other weird bugs...
  - launching rust when Firefox starts, and IPCing to it
  - launching rust as OS process, and IPCing to it
- investigated using nacl in rust code
  - the crypto lib aka "salt", via the libsodium fork
  - https://cr.yp.to/highspeed/naclcrypto-20090310.pdf
- prepared hotfix for color distortion in video on AMD cards for 57
  - https://bugzil.la/1418556

2017-11-10
----------
- discussed signing options for XPIs

  from updating out-of-cycle on 57.0
  - https://bugzil.la/1376814

2017-11-08
----------
- followed up on sandboxing bug that might prevent some system add-ons
  from updating out-of-cycle on 57.0
  - https://bugzil.la/1376814
  - specifically would affect framescripts and contentaccessible chrome/resource
    URLs
  - mythmon is running a test today to see if shield about: page works
    correctly after an update on 57 beta
- discussed tor meeting minutes w/ add-ons folks
  - https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tbb-dev/2017-November/000652.html
  - tl;dr - they might not need to be an extension at all; if they do,
    it might not be as complex as it appears (Tor works over HTTPS AFAICT,
    and there are APIs for the proxy stuff).
    - native connect to a standalone app is also doable
    - or, not be an extension at all and spin up a separate firefox process...

2017-11-07
----------
- filed bug to remove client-side Telemetry Experiments support
  - https://bugzil.la/1415284
- reviewed system add-on update to fix search engine geo prefs
  - https://github.com/mozilla/one-off-system-add-ons/pull/71#pullrequestreview-74915429
- discussed w/ shield and AMO folks which suffix to use for shield addon IDs
  - AMO blocks @mozilla.org/com, probably want @\*.mozilla.org/com as well
- 1:1

2017-11-06
----------
- helped francois test system add-on update to roll back TP UI changes, if needed
  - https://gist.github.com/rhelmer/b392e97d0b6ff81c06c205c760050c2b
- discussed removing telemetry experiments w/ add-ons folks
- reviewed system add-on update (TLS middlebox experiment)
  - https://github.com/mozilla/one-off-system-add-ons/pull/70
- worked on tests for tracking protection study
- filed bug about page action icons being too restrictive
  - https://bugzil.la/1414966
  - this would make tracking protection study much easier to do as a webext

2017-11-03
----------
- highlights from the last few weeks:
  - tracking protection study
    - this is on hold til post-57, still working on tests
      - webrequest onBeforeRequest doesn't seem to be firing for the local
        test page
  - trying determine what the post-57 future of bootstrapped add-ons will be
  - thinking about how to make gofaster less of a niche and more of a
    basic part of mozilla
  - soliciting mozillian's opinions on what they'd like to see in etherpad
  - looking at what we can remove post-57 from addons manager
    - old-style hotfix
    - telemetry experiments
    - ???

2017-10-24
----------
- highlights from the last few weeks:
  - only load system add-ons from a built-in list
    - https://bugzil.la/1348981
    - list is generated at build time and packaged into omni jar
    - required some C++ changes, mostly to test properly
- tracking protection study
  - rewrote as legacy-style bootstrapped add-on, using XUL etc
    - not really possible to get the desired UX via webextensions, yet
      - page action restrictions for example (image only, 16x16)
    - blending in with the Firefox UI becomes much simpler
    - it is possible to share enough underlying code with webextension
      impl that there isnt an advantage to having the overhead of communicating
      with an embedded webext
  - started developing this in-tree so mochitest can be used and mozilla
    "try" infra can produce builds
  - probably can't use shield since this needs to run so early in startup
    to be useful... funnelcake will work here and we can test builds from
    the "try" infra (see above)
- reviews on add-ons manager, shield, helped out with various studies
  

2017-08-30
----------
- highlights from the last few weeks:
  - fixed addon manager bug when user has unicode in profile names
    - https://bugzil.la/1389160
    - turns out we don't test this case at all! filed a few test harness
      bugs
      - https://bugzil.la/1392308
      - https://bugzil.la/1395414
  - put up patch to pass Flow null check violations Mossop found
    - https://bugzil.la/1395425
    - nice opportunity to rewrite to async/await to make this sort of bug
      less likely
      - https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/174764/diff/1#file5137262
  - worked on tracking protection study
    - https://github.com/rhelmer/tracking-protection-study/
    - refactored existing study to make more configurable at runtime
      - https://github.com/rhelmer/tracking-protection-study/blob/master/extension/Config.jsm
    - used embedded webextension for UI
      - requires message passing to bootstrap.js
      - https://github.com/rhelmer/tracking-protection-study/tree/master/extension/webextension
      - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Embedded_WebExtensions
    - found some problems with current tracking protection impl for our purposes:
      - onSecurityChange is only sent if the nsIChannel is connected to the document loaded in the currently-focused tab. This means that we can get an accurate count of blocked resources only if the tab is focused - otherwise the onSecurityChange event is only observed once per focus
        - https://bugzil.la/1388916 is filed to fix this
      - lots of known breakage on real-world sites
        - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1101005
      - API isn't very amenable to adding a WE API, but I think that's the right
        thing to do long-term.
    - resurrected old sphinx-js patches to land in mozilla-central, now that
      Mozilla infra can handle building and hosting sphinx docs
      - https://bugzil.la/1389341

2017-08-01
----------
- bisected regression range for unwanted system add-on first-run behavior
  - https://bugzil.la/1386295
  - was broken by one of the perf improvements in 55
  - causes brand-new system add-ons to not appear on first-run in a new profile

  - https://bugzil.la/1373487
- investigated disappearing system add-ons in artifact (dev) build
  - https://bugzil.la/1371273
  - turned out to be profile switching which isn't really well supported :/
    - might disable or strongly encourage profile switching instead...
    - probably will fix it anyway
- participated in browser-arch discussion around multi-process and updates
- worked on bug where system add-on and hotfix updates show up in about:addons
  if it is open during update
  - https://bugzil.la/1367800
  - users still can't disable or remove, so not harmful just looks glitchy
  - again, simple code fix, complex test :/


2017-06-14
----------
- worked on refining updates proposal
- reviewed bug showing unsigned legacy extensions in legacy section
  - https://bugzil.la/1371752
  - this is only for builds that allow disabling signing so pretty minor impact
- worked on bug about race in addons manager module
  - https://bugzil.la/1371363
  - this only happens for firefox-internal callers doing it in the wrong order
    - telemetry was bit by this but fixed it in their code
    - it's a footgun we should remove
  - have it done other than the dang xpcshell test :/

  - lots of perf-related addons manager reviews
  - helping to get crash reporting going for extension process
    - https://bugzil.la/1353168
  - Firefox arch review meetings and discussion
  - helped out w/ Screenshots landing
    - also helping to look into perf issues - there are some perf problems
      with using a WebExtension, they may put a bit more of the add-on
      into the bootstrap.js side to mitigate
  - worked on update proposal
  - learning how to better use the gecko profiler

2017-05-08
----------
- finally able to reproduce screenshots bug
  - https://bugzil.la/1355998
  - looks like it only happens on win7 opt, nowhere else
  - also it's in the about:addons windowed code, which is known to
    be buggy and we've announced support to remove anyway \o/
- PTO in afternoon

2017-05-03
----------
- reviewing https://bugzil.la/1356826
    - has a controversial bit that I was holding off on while discussing
- further work to re-enable test that started breaking for screenshots when
  enabled
  - https://bugzil.la/1355998
  - taking lots of time due to waiting for tryserver...
- more investigatory work on moving system add-ons into omni jar
  - https://bugzil.la/1357205
  - this will help startup perf and make malware dropping in a new XPI
    less trivial.
- made suggestions for shipping mortar and pdf.js side-by-side
  - https://bugzil.la/1360494

2017-05-03
----------
- tried to re-enable test that started breaking for screenshots when enabled
  - https://bugzil.la/1355998
  - not able to repro, standard8 thinks it might be due to broken tests
    on m-c, going to try rebasing tmrw,

2017-04-19
----------
- r+ on adding whether add-on is a webextension to telemetry
  - https://bugzil.la/1357460
- looked into why screenshots loaded as temp addon does not seem to
  override the built-in
  - https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/pull/2704
  - turned out this was due to the webextension not being shut down
    by bootstrap shutdown()

2017-04-18
----------
- working on adding whether add-on is a webextension to telemetry
  - https://bugzil.la/1357460
- more reviews

  - reasoning in https://bugzil.la/1231202#c9
- worked on bug to validate built-in system add-ons against list of known IDs
  - https://bugzil.la/1348981
  - this will eliminate one of the dirs we need to scan at startup, which
    we are trying to eliminate from AddonManager for 55.


2017-03-26
----------
- landed unregister for update timer manager
  - https://bugzil.la/1350471

    -https://github.com/mozilla/normandy/issues/588

2017-03-24
----------
- doing some self-triage, lots of old bugs hanging around.
- started working on refactoring to reduce the amount of code needed for new install locations in addons manager

2017-01-17
----------
- caught up on reviews and feedback requests

2017-01-09 -> 2017-01-13

2017-01-05
----------
- reviewed the first half of webext permission prompt patches
  - https://bugzil.la/1308295
- chatted w/ devtools team about upcoming plans
- fixed even more test failures for ServiceRequest (TLS 1.3 disabling XHR replacement) onto beta
  - https://bugzil.la/1325501
  - mostly just minor stuff like imports that haven't made it to beta yet
  - looks like it stuck this time \o/

- feedback on aswan removing support for multiple installs via InstallTrigger
  - https://bugzil.la/1323129
- feedback on markh's work on getting sync to reliably tell which addons
  came from AMO and are therefore eligible for syncing
  - https://bugzil.la/1285866
  - tl;dr - we should keep the list of add-ons installed from AMO more
    consistent, AFAICT we only populate this "DB" (really a JSON file)
    once per day along with the addons check.
- 1:1
- skipped out on addons manager triage due to plumbing-related issues :O

2016-12-20
----------

    that does XHR, consulted w/ ehsan about doing it in the XHR implementations
    instead. put up patch with f?ehsan

2016-11-29
----------
- minor fallout for uplift request for e10srollout-supporting change
  - https://bugzil.la/1272446
  - I had forgotten to `hg add` the unit test on the beta branch,
    so it didn't appear in the diff /o\
    - also, was wrong that Aurora didn't need its own patch
  - attached new patches for beta and aurora which stuck \o/
- did some addons manager triage of existing open bugs w/ aswan
- responded to webextensions concerns on dev-addons list
- blogged about a few side projects
  - http://rhelmer.org/blog/aboutaddons-in-react.html

- reviews
  - remove string generics
    - https://bugzil.la/1319939

    - https://bugzil.la/1308656

2016-11-23
----------
- helped out w/ getting shield recipe client system add-on build+test in moz-central working
  - https://github.com/mythmon/normandy-addon/pull/1
  - https://github.com/mythmon/normandy-addon/pull/2

- GoFaster meeting
- Felipe ran into an issue with AddonManager and e10srollout where he wants to identify
  whether add-ons explicitly opted out of multiprocess compatibility, but currently
  only a boolean is stored after the manifest is parsed.

  Worked on providing a way to cause all manifests to be re-read when the addons DB
  schema version is bumped - this way Felipe could add a new property to the DB which is
  set based on the presence of the multiProcessCompatible property, and all add-on
  manifests will be re-read when a schema version bump comes with the next app update.

  - https://bugzil.la/1272446


2016-11-21
----------
- started chatting w/ folks about felipe's idea for update experiment
  - https://bugzil.la/1307568
  - tl;dr we suspect MITM proxies are breaking different updates, including
    but not limites to system add-ons, due to cert pinning requirements
- looked into what happens when balrog sends 404 to GMP/SystemAddon update
  - currently HTTP status is ignored :/ so XML is read, but will throw if
    can't be parsed
    - TODO file bug
- responded to some needinfos
  - Firefox for Android sending bad versions in GMP updates
    - https://bugzil.la/1319200
  - Addons manager does not store difference between unset multiprocess and
    set xplicitly false in manifest
    - https://bugzil.la/1314429
    - we should be able to do this by bumping the schema version and adding
      a new property to store this. the schema bump should cause all addon
      manifests to be re-read.

2016-11-11

2016-11-14
----------
- worked on issue with sync addon DB loading throwing exception when
  dev edition theme is the default
  - https://bugzil.la/1313960
  - the issue of why we are doing sync load here is a tricky one... for now
    going to settle for making the exception go away (seems to just be a case
    of a programmer error+no test around interrupting async load when sync
    load has completed in the meantime.

    Going to split out the "how to make this right" issue from the "make
    it work as intended"

2016-08-03
----------
- Existing JS scoping bug was fixed, which caused a system add-on test to fail
  - https://bugzil.la/1291569
  - turns out it wasn't running the tests we thought it was, fortunately only
    one minor feature had a legit broken test (empty add-on set means to remove
    all updates and to disable all built-in add-ons) - will probably just remove
    the feature.

2016-07-12
----------
- did a little symbolapi investigation
  - looking at strace output w/ ddurst, race condition with files seems possible
  - concurrency model is a bit baffling - there's tornado and concurrent.futures in use, and there are two processes. Need to figure this out before we can determine the problem for sure and make appropriate fix.

    removing a lot of the current hard-coding.
  - mostly working now, getting tests to pass and need to make some
    decisions like what to do if a set fails to upgrade. Also, one
    add-on delaying needs to delay upgrade for the whole set...
- looked into about:debugging temporary add-on loader issue w/ billm and kmag

      - looks dead easy on Mac: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSOpenPanel\_Class/index.html
      - Windows (Vista+) and GTK would need more work, might be more than this feature warrants :/
      - given that, might make sense to have a better workaround in the UI

    the features dir when the add-ons manager starts up
